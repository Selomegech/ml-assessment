### **Guide to Running on Google Colab**

This guide will help you run the first two tasks of the project without any complex configuration. You will use Google Colab, which provides a free, ready-to-use environment directly in your web browser.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Open Google Colab:** Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).

2.  **For Task 1:**

      * Click on `File` -\> `New notebook`.
      * Name the notebook `task1.ipynb`.
      * Copy all the code from the **Task 1 Notebook (`task1.ipynb`)** section below and paste it into a single cell in your new Colab notebook.
      * Click the "Play" button (▶️) on the left side of the cell to run it. The code will automatically download the dataset, preprocess it, and display the analysis charts.

3.  **For Task 2:**

      * Create another new notebook by clicking `File` -\> `New notebook`.
      * Name this one `task2.ipynb`.
      * Copy all the code from the **Task 2 Notebook (`task2.ipynb`)** section below and paste it into a single cell.
      * Click the "Play" button (▶️) to run it. This script will install the necessary libraries, download models, and then show you examples of information extraction and summarization.
